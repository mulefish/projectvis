# goal
Take a react project and create a dataviz of it. This will work to show a dataviz of a project OR of different branches of the same project 



# techstack
python + html5canvas

# tdd/test data 
For tdd/test data I d/l https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app. This is here just provide a complicated node project to visualize, as it is well formed react code and it is a non-trivial project. I have removed all real logic from my copy. I kept just the shell of that project. I put one copy into a dir named 'data1' and another, slightly different, copy into 'data2'.
